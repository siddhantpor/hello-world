# hello-world
first repository [6/20/2021]

well, this is the first repository on my personal account... you see, I've used GitHub for school projects, thus I have a school account. But I never had my own personal GitHub account; therefore, here I am! Excited to start my internship at CodeDay Labs -- after all, I am here to learn!

back at it again! [2/19/2022]

this time? learning react :)
